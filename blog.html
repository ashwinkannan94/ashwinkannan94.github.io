Today was quite an eventful day for reasons that will be explained in the following paragraphs. First off, I woke up at 6 in the morning again, an unexplained phenomenon which occurred yesterday as well. Then I went for a run around the neighborhood which was very pleasant. I learned a lot of new thing such as there is a park really close by where soccer games happen every weekend and there is a dog park like a minute away which would be really cool to visit at another time. I then drove about 25 minutes to get a floor lamp off someone who was moving out of his apartment. He turned out to be selling a quad copter as well and although that was an unplanned purchase, soon I found out it was well worth the money I bought it for. The quad copter comes with a camera installed which is really cool but it takes some time to master operating it.

		Today was a very interesting day for a lot of reasons so lets start from
		the morning. I woke up at 6am, no alarm or anything, something that I never
		do unless I have to and I usually need an alarm. Summer has gone by with me
		waking up around 8 or 9 every morning and definitely needing an alarm to wake 
		up then as well. After I woke up, I went grocery shopping, again something that 
		I have not done in like three months due to being home for the summer but today
		it was like an instinct to go buy some bread, cheese, hummus and veggies for 
		making breakfast and lunch. At around noon, after eating breaking and showering and 
		such, I decided to go to the UCSD campus for the seminar, which is the reason why I 
		drove down to SD for 4 days. After finishing the seminar at 4, me and one of my friends 
		decided to get some lunch. We went to a new mexican restaurant which is near my house and 
		it was awful. San Diego is known for its Mexican food, especially the fast food restaurants
		such as Vallartas and Cotixans for having delicious food 24 hours a day 7 days a week. After 
		eating, we decided to never go to this restaurant again. In the evening, I hung out with a 
		couple of my friends who are in San Diego for the summer taking summer classes. It was a great
		night of relaxing and catching up with friends.

		The drive down to San Diego took a little longer than what I had expected.
		My passenger in the car was a friend also from EWB who is attending the 
		meeting as well. The first part of the drive from my house to hers, to pick 
		her up, was quite fast considering that I had to drive through some pretty
		roads that were backed up due to commuters trying to get to work and those 
		few trying to get to their vacation spots for the weekend. After picking her 
		up, we hit 101 South and after a few patches of light traffic, we took the 152
		in efforts of getting on the 5. The 152 was slow due to a cop pulling over a truck 
		but after that, the roads were clear. We skipped eating till we reached Tejon Ranch,
		the beginning of the Grape Vine, or Tejon pass as some like to call it. After grabbing 
		a quick bite, we were back on the road. After the pass, we hit LA traffic immediately. 
		My passenger decided to find alternate routes and we ended up taking the 210 to go towards
		Pasadena, a route that Google Maps told us was faster. I was a skeptical at first, considering
		that we were travelling East, away from San Diego but it all made sense soon. After roaming around
		the streets of Pasadena for a while, due to turn restrictions and construction zones, we took the 710
		and soon were back on the 5. To my surprise, we had crossed LA and were now in Santa Ana. I was truly 
		shocked, primarily due to my lack of knowledge of the various directions that the 5 goes in. After this, 
		although with many requests from my friend to take other freeways to avoid traffic, I put my trust in the 5
		and with the carpool lanes being restricted to cars with 2 or more people, we were cruising through Irvine and 
		were in San Diego way earlier than either of us expected. The lesson that I learned from this trip was that
		sometimes it can be good to listen to others who have gone through the dilemma that you are currently
		facing and at other times, it is good to just listen to yourself and believe that what you are doing is 
		for the best. Differentiating between the two can be tough but the most important part is to trust your gut.</p>

		Unfortunately I was unable to take pictures of the house I am staying at for the rest of the school year but 
		maybe I will have the opportunity to do so tomorrow. There is literally nothing in my room other than a closet,
		no lights or anything. I am going to need to go shopping for some groceries and supplies for the next two days
		as well as buy some floor lamps and things for lighing up the room from some of my fellow students at UCSD.</P>

		Today marks the day that I start this blog, and hopefully start posting daily. 
		After looking through blog backgrounds for the last 30 minutes to see which
		one I like the best and which one will represent me the best, I have decided
		to keep it nice and simple. So much for all the cool backgrounds that showed
		up on the Google search. On another topic, tomorrow I embark on a trip to San Diego 
		for a meeting that I have on Friday
		to become a principal member of EWB. A principal member, although not too 
		relevant, means that I have some importance in the club and being the project
		lead of the Rwanda Project, that seems to make sense. I am really looking forward
		to the drive down for two reasons: one- my parents trust me enough to take the car
		down without either of being in it, which is awesome and two- I get to have a car in
		San Diego for 2 days and explore the city, something which I have not done. Once in 
		San Diego, I get to see the house that I am living in next year with a few friends who
		I have had since freshman year and I have a feeling that the year is going to be awesome.
		Although being updated by text about the condition of the house from the people living there
		right now is nice, there is nothing like going and seeing it in person. I will update 
		a picture of the house, the outside and the inside on my post tomorrow (hopefully). 
		Going to get back to getting ready for tomorrow now. Adios!
