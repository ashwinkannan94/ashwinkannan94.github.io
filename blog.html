		Today marks the day that I start this blog, and hopefully start posting daily. 
		After looking through blog backgrounds for the last 30 minutes to see which
		one I like the best and which one will represent me the best, I have decided
		to keep it nice and simple. So much for all the cool backgrounds that showed
		up on the Google search. On another topic, tomorrow I embark on a trip to San Diego 
		for a meeting that I have on Friday
		to become a principal member of EWB. A principal member, although not too 
		relevant, means that I have some importance in the club and being the project
		lead of the Rwanda Project, that seems to make sense. I am really looking forward
		to the drive down for two reasons: one- my parents trust me enough to take the car
		down without either of being in it, which is awesome and two- I get to have a car in
		San Diego for 2 days and explore the city, something which I have not done. Once in 
		San Diego, I get to see the house that I am living in next year with a few friends who
		I have had since freshman year and I have a feeling that the year is going to be awesome.
		Although being updated by text about the condition of the house from the people living there
		right now is nice, there is nothing like going and seeing it in person. I will update 
		a picture of the house, the outside and the inside on my post tomorrow (hopefully). 
		Going to get back to getting ready for tomorrow now. Adios!
